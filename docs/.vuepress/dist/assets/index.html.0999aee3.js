You can even offer multiple payment plans to the customer for them to choose the most appropriate option for them.</p><p>Orders can of course always be paid in full at checkout\xA0by card or, in certain circumstances, by BACs (Bank Transfer) too. Payment plans build on these payment methods allowing you the option to attempt automatic collection of an instalment where a customer is paying by card. Where this isn&#39;t possible (if the customer is paying instalments by BACs)\xA0or fails (e.g. the saved card on record has since expired) then an instalment payment instruction is sent directing the customer on how to pay the scheduled instalment either by making another bank transfer, or by logging into their Solidrock profile and paying by card.</p><h3 id="wristband-assignment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wristband-assignment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Wristband Assignment</h3><p>If your event uses wristbands, or any other uniquely identifiable ID pass\xA0on-site you can now assign these to tickets within Solidrock either by entering the unique ID of the band or pass, or by scanning a QR Code or Barcode.
