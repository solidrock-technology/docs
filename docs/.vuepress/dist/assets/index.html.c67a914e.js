Either by being created by organisation admins which provides a greater opportunity to verify and moderate the groups being registered, but can be time consuming. Or by allowing groups to be registered publicly by any Solidrock account holder for a given event, which makes registration quick but removes some of the opportunity for organisation admins to verify the groups that are being registered in the system for their events.</p><h4 id="_1-registered-by-organisation-admins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-registered-by-organisation-admins" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1. Registered by Organisation Admins</h4><p>This is the default bahaviour for groups in Solidrock and means that only organisation admins can create groups and group coordinators for those groups. This option allows organisations to have full control of the groups associated to their events.</p><p>Due to the nature of having this level of moderation, any &#39;Group Select&#39; fields then used within custom forms created to capture delegate details for tickets and extras can use a dropdown and search-to-find by name feature for those making bookings to locate the appropriate group to assign their tickets too.</p><h4 id="_2-public-group-registrations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-public-group-registrations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. Public Group Registrations</h4><p>There are 2 ways to enable this functionality:</p><ol><li><p>Enable it globally for every event that uses a particular &#39;Group Set&#39; from the &#39;Group Set&#39; edit page by going to &#39;Admin Console&#39; &gt; &#39;Groups&#39;, finding the group set and choosing the &#39;Edit&#39; option from the actions menu. If enabled globally you will be able to send people to the public registration webpage (available from the Group Set &#39;Manage&#39; page) so they can register their group ahead of making a booking. Once registered they will be shown \u2013and receive by email\u2013 their group&#39;s unique code to use for their bookings and can be distributed to other Lead Bookers who need to assign their tickets to the same group.</p></li><li><p>Enable it at the custom field level. Doing it this way means you don&#39;t need to have public group registrations enabled for every event that uses a particular group set, but can be more granular in deciding which events should allow this option and which should not. When creating or editing a &#39;Group Select&#39; field from the &#39;Admin Console&#39; &gt; &#39;Form Builder&#39; &gt; &#39;Fields&#39; area you will have the option to enable this feature. Fields setup in this way will provide an instruction to LEad Bookers that they must enter the unique group code, or if they themselves are the group coordinator that they can register a group and be sent the unique code to use.</p></li></ol><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Change in field behaviour</p><p>When the setting is enabled globally for a Group Set, or individually for a given Group Select field the behaviour of assigning tickets to groups changes for Lead Bookers.
