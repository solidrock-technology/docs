Access levels with Solidrock serve no purpose beyond being a label that can be viewed in the backend by administrators and when printing Team Passes (Badges/Lanyards) from the system. On the printed pass, the access levels that each team and therefore each team member have for the team are written which can therefore be used as a visual security measure for those working at the event.</p><p>Access Levels can be anything you like, but some common examples are:</p><ul><li>Access All Areas (AAA)</li><li>Backstage</li><li>Green Room</li><li>Operations</li><li>Kids Venues</li><li>Catering</li></ul>',4),r=[n];function i(l,o){return a(),s("div",null,r)}var d=e(c,[["render",i],["__file","access.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
