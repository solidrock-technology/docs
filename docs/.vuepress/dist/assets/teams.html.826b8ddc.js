They can be called whatever you&#39;d like but some common examples include:</p><ul><li>Setup \u2013 At event / During event</li><li>Setdown / Takedown</li></ul><p>Each serving time must have a name and set of dates to indicate what time period they cover. They can also optionally include a description to provide more context. This is especially useful to provide clarity to those wanting to be team members as all of this detail is shown to those booking in as they decide when they want to be on team.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>A team can be in one or more serving time categories.</p></div><h2 id="general-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#general-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> General Information</h2><h3 id="team-name" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#team-name" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Team Name</h3><p>The name of the team, visible to those booking team member tickets.</p><h3 id="team-description" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#team-description" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Team Description</h3><p>A description of the team, its function, how it operates and the expectations of those who request to join it.</p><h3 id="team-image" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#team-image" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Team Image</h3><p>An optional image to give a visual cue to what the team is.</p><p>Team images can be up to 8MB in size and any of the following file types: <code>PNG</code>, <code>JPEG</code> or <code>GIF</code>.</p><h3 id="full-time-members-required" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#full-time-members-required" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Full-Time Members Required</h3><p>The total number of full-time team members required for a team.
