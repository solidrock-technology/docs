# Front of House - Arrivals

You've done the hard work of marketing your event, selling the tickets and now people are starting to arrive on site.

Front of House Arrivals is your one-stop shop for checking people in to the event which is monitored throughout the course of the event providing you powerful data such as:

- how many people are on site right now
- how often are people arriving and leaving over the course of the event
- which are the busiest venues and entrances

...and much more!

## Pre-Arrival Setup

Every event managed through Solidrock is automatically setup with a 'Main Event' venue and 'Main Entrance'. From the Venues area in the event management backend you can rename this venue and create other venues and entrances as needed for your event.

When working with the Arrivals functionality you will first select which venue you are managing the arrivals for, and optionally also the entrance your delegates are arriving through.

## Managing Arrivals

From the [Front of House landing page](https://events.solidrock.io/foh) choose the event you want to handle the arrivals for and then select the 'Arrivals' option from the available list.

Arrivals can be managed across multiple devices in parallel allowing you to have as many people as needed for the size of your event, welcoming your delegates and checking them in through one or more separate entrances.

Once you have selected the venue you're managing arrivals for you will be taken to the arrivals page, broken down into 3 core functions:

1. Dashboard
2. Ticket and Event Pass scanning
3. Ticket Search

From here you can check and change the entrance you are checking people through by clicking on the cog icon.

### Dashboard

The dashboard displays the number of tickets checked in to the selected venue as a proportion of the total number of tickets sold for the event.

In addition, if your event is setup with [Ticket Sets]('/guide/tickets/ticket-set') the dashboard lists the breakdown of how many tickets from within each set have also been checked in to the selected venue.

The figures are automatically kept in sync when multiple people and devices are being used to check people in to the same venue so everyone can see the up-to-date totals.

### Search

In addition to scanning a digital ticket or event pass you can also search for tickets by delegate name, order reference and unique ticket ID. Results will be listed alphabetically by surname.

Each result will indicate where known:

- the delegate name
- the unique ticket ID
- the ticket name (e.g. Team Member, Early Bird, V.I.P, Exhibitor etc)
- the group they're with
- whether or not they are checked in already to this venue, indicated by the date and time they were checked in
- whether or not they have been assigned an event pass or wristband, indicated by listing the unique ID of the pass.

In addition to this at a glance information you can check a person in and out of the selected venue using the checkmark icon as well as associate an event pass or wristband to the person using the wristband icon.

Clicking on a ticket result returned from the search will open a window providing a little more detail about the delegate. In addition to what was listed in the search result row you will also see:

- The date and time the ticket was booked and who by (the Lead Booker)
- any teams they have applied to be on, and the approval status
- The check-in information for this delegate and this venue - a record of all the times they checked in and out.
- The Event Pass/Wristband details including the currently active ID and any previous IDs they may have been issued that have had to be replaced for one reason or other (e.g. damaged, lost, stolen) alsongside the date and time each pass or wristband was issued.

## Scanning

### Digital Tickets

All completed and paid tickets in Solidrock are available as a digital ticket downloads - each of which displays a unique QR code. This QR code can be scanned via your devices built-in camera(s) or external camera/webcam through the scan tab.

### Event Pass or Wristband

Once you have issued an event pass, wristband or similar with a barcode or QR code printed you can also use the scanner to read those search for the associated ticket.

**NOTE:** Tickets must have been associated to an event pass or wristband before this scan-to-search functionality will work.

::: tip
Scanning using a camera is often more reliable when done in an environment with plenty of light.
:::

If your device has multiple available cameras (e.g. front facing and rear facing) you can click the rotate icon to change the camera being used.

As an alternative to using a device's camera you can also use a barcode reader to scan barcodes and QR codes to carry out a search. Depending on your needs you may use barcode readers that are either plugged in by USB or paired over Bluetooth to a computer, tablet or mobile device.

Barcode scanners are often much quicker to read a barcode than a device's camera and may be the preferred choice if speed is of the essence to get people through the door.

:::warning Barcode Reader Requirements
The barcode readers you choose **must** be compatible with 1D and 2D codes and be configured to mark the scan complete by sending a 'Carriage Return' (Enter key) character.

Bluetooth enabled devices should use the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol.
:::

:::tip
If you find that nothing is happening when you perform a scan using a barcode reader, check that the keyboard cursor is within the search input field first, then use the scanner again.

### Connecting Bluetooth Barcode Scanners
To connect your barcode scanner via Bluetooth: 

- Power on the scanner
- Make sure your barcode scanning device is discoverable via Bluetooth.
- Make sure the device is in range with Bluetooth turned on 
- Pressing the scan button will initiate the attempts to connect. 
- Your barcode scanner will now be discoverable in your deviceâ€™s Bluetooth connections. 
- If a connection is made, the blue light will stop blinking and turn solid. 
- If a connection is not made after several attempt the scanner will emit a long beep (and the blue light will turn off).

**NOTE:** When using the smartphone cradle scanner, your keyboard may be hidden - if needed (e.g. for manual barcode input), press and hold the scan button on the cradle to access your keyboard.

:::tip 
In order to make your scanner discoverable via Bluetooth, you may need to scan a 'Bluetooth Transmit' barcode, often supplied with your scanner.
