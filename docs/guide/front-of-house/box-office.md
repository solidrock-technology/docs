# Front of House - Box Office

If you sell tickets or extras on-site during your event, such as day tickets and merchandise, you can use the Solidrock Box Office to perform this function and have it all recorded into your Solidrock event data.

The Box Office will list available (not sold out, enabled and within the available from and to dates) [Tickets](/guide/tickets/ticket-options) & [Extras](/guide/extras) as specified within the event management backend.

## Tickets

For each ticket added to a Box Office order you can optionally add a delegate name and date of birth, as well as assign an event pass or wristband ID.

Assigning an event pass or wristband ID can be done by either entering the ID manually in the input field, by scanning using a barcode reader, or scanning using a device's camera.

Use the edit pencil icon to access these functions for each of the tickets in the cart.

## Discounts

You can optionally assign an order level discount to a Box Office order by entering the discount code.

## Fees

Where an event is setup to charge the customer the Solidrock fees on top of the ticket and extra costs you will be presented the fee amount so you can confirm that ahead of completing the order.

## Order Completion

To complete a Box Office order click the green 'Total' button which will also indicate the order total and follow the on-screen instructions.

:::warning Payment
At this time Solidrock is unable to handle the payment of Box Office orders. Instead you should have payment mechanisms setup in parallel - such as a card reader terminal or option to pay by cash.

Once you have collected payment you can indicate as such within the Solidrock Box Office.

The final step to completing an order is to choose whether to complete the order as a 'Guest' or a 'Lead Booker'.

### Guest

Selecting to complete as a guest associated the final order with the 'Box Office' throughout the system instead of a real person and Solidrock account.

### Lead Booker

To complete the order as a real Lead Booker you must provide the first name, last name and email address of the person. The Box Office will then search for any existing Solidrock accounts with those details and if a match is found associate this order to their account so they can view it from their ['My Bookings'](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/profile/my-bookings) profile area in the future. If no match is found a new Solidrock account will be registered for them and the order associated. In both cases, the Box Office is then able to email a receipt to the Lead Booker for their records.

Once complete, the Box Office terminal will reset ready for the next order to be placed.
