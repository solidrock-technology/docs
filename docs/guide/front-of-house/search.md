# Front of House - Search

The Front of House Search feature is a read-only operational function that allows you to search for completed and paid for tickets in Solidrock by:

- Delegate name
- Order Reference
- Unique Ticket ID
- Event Pass or Wristband ID

Unlike with the ticket search from in [Arrivals](/guide/front-of-house/arrivals) there are no actions available to check a person in or out, or to assign a wristband.

You can still perform a search by scanning a digital ticket, event pass or wristband barcode or QR Code.

:::tip Use Case
The search facility is useful for those, perhaps on security teams, who don't need (or shouldn't have) full access the event management backend but who do need to be able to find a ticket or tickets and some associated detail in scenarios where someone may be lost on site or has been involved in an incident.
