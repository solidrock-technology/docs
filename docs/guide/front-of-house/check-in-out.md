# Front of House - Check In &amp; Out

Like [Front of House Arrivals](/guide/front-of-house/arrivals) the check in &amp; out functions will return search results when performing a search either by entering text in the search field or scanning a barcode or QR code. You can click on the result card(s) to perform the check in or out operation.

If you try to check a person in who is already checked in, you will be prompted that they are already marked as checked in and asked if you want to override and check them in again using the current date and time. Likewise, if you try to check a person out who is not checked in, you will be prompted that they are not checked in and asked if you want to override and check them out using the current date and time.

If 0 or more than 1 result is found, an error will be returned indicating that the check in or out operation could not be performed.

:::tip Use Case
