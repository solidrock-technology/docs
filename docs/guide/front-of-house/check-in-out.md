# Front of House - Check In &amp; Out

Unlike [Front of House Arrivals](/guide/front-of-house/arrivals) the quick check in &amp; out functions do not return search results when performing a search either by entering text in the search field or scanning a barcode or QR code.

These functions also restrict the search terms to only digitial ticket, event pass and wristband codes as well as unique ticket IDs. You cannot search by delegate name or order reference.

If 1 result is found, the operation to check in or out that ticket from the venue, through the selected entrance, will be carried out.

If 0 or more than 1 result is found, an error will be returned indicating that the check in or out operation could not be performed.

:::tip Use Case
These check in and out functions are primarily tailored around quickly checking people into and out of venues where it is not necessary to know any details about the people other than that they do or do not have a ticket for the event.

## Venues & Entrances/Exits

Like the Arrivals feature you can select which venue you are checking people into and out of as well as the entrance/exit (where a venue has multiple entrances or exits).

These are set within the Venues area of the event manageent backend.
