# Time Restricted Items

When creating or editing tickets, extras and bundles, you have the option to mark that item as 'Time Restricted'.
This option enables a 30-minute inactivity timer while that item is in an unpaid order.

Any items that are time restricted will be marked as such on both the booking flow for Lead Bookers and also in the admin backend in the relevant ticket options, extra and bundle index lists.

## Inactivity Timer

When a Lead Booker adds a time restricted item to their order, a 30-minute timer will start.
The timer will re-start when they are active within an order.

For example, every time the Lead Booker moves pages within the booking process, adds items to their basket or saves ticket or extra details, the 30-minute timer will restart.

### Timed-out Items

When the timer reaches 5 minutes remaining, a pop-up will appear for the Lead Booker to give them the option to extend their session and reset the timer to 30 minutes, along with a countdown of how long is left.

If the Lead Booker does not extend their session, then the time-restricted items will be deleted from their order.

If the Lead Booker logs out, or closes their window while time restricted items remain in their order, we will automatically remove the time restricted items after 30 minutes without further changes to their order.
