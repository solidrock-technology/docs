# Ticket Sets

Ticket sets are a way for you to group and categorise your tickets in such a way that will help provide more of an overview of the delegates coming to your event.

You may for example have multiple tickets related to children, especially if you have price breaks for the event and if you sell tickets in advance and on the door. Creating a ticket set for 'Children' and then applying that to each of the various tickets that would be applicable for a child would then provide you a top-level figure for how many children will be attending the event, visible both from the event dashboard as well as the Ticket Sets index page.
