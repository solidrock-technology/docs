# Accounts

Anyone wishing to book in to an event or create and manage events of their own requires an account.

## Registration

Accounts are registered either from the [registration page](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/register) or by an existing user with relevant permissions from within the backend control panel.

Accounts are registered through a secure invitation system meaning only the account holder is able to set and update their password.

## Account Types

Accounts take the form of different roles/types including (in order of most privileges to least):

- Organisation Admin
- Group Coordinator
- Lead Booker
- Team Member
- Team Leader

An account can have one or more types associated with it. For example you could be a Team Leader for Event ‘A’ run by Organisation ‘X’, and a Lead Booker for Event ‘B’ run by Organisation ‘Y’.

Accounts Types are automatically assigend for Lead Bookers and Team Members through the frontend booking process. All other account types must be assigned through the backend control panel.

### Organisation Admin

An organisation admin has permission to access the backend control panel to create and manage their own events, including access to:

- Event Detail (incl. dates, description, location, payment options, invoice/receipt email customisations)
- Sales Information
- Orders
- Ticket & Extras management
- Discounts
- Teams:
  - Team Leaders
  - Team Members
  - Access Levels
  - Approval Criteria
- Reporting
- Accounts:
  - Create new accounts
  - See account details for those accounts who have made a booking for one or more of the orginasiers events

### Group Coordinator

Group Coordinators are those who lead and manage groups of event delegates. Coordinators are assigned to one or more [groups](/guide/groups.md). It is possible for an event organiser to provide alternative features and limits to Group Coordinators than regular bookers. For example a Group Coordinator may be able to:

- Book more tickets in a single order
- Complete and pay for their order without filling in all the usual required ticket details
- Pay for orders using other payment options than by card (e.g. Bank Transfer/BACs)

When logged in to the [profile area](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/profile) the Group Coordinator will be able to see which Groups they have been assigned to, for which events and furthermore see who has booked in to those events, associated with their group.
