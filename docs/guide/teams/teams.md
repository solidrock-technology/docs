# Team Management

Create and manage the teams required to run the event.

::: warning
You will need to create at least 1 [serving time](#serving-times) before you can create teams.
:::

## Serving Times

Serving Times are a way to organise and categorise your teams by time periods. You can create as many as required but must have at least 1 before being able to create teams themselves. 
They can be called whatever you'd like but some common examples include:

- Setup
â€“ At event / During event
- Set-down / Take-down

Each serving time must have a name and set of dates to indicate what time period they cover. They can also optionally include a description to provide more context. This is especially useful to provide clarity to those wanting to be team members as all of this detail is shown to those booking in as they decide when they want to be on team.

::: tip
A team can be in one or more serving time categories.
:::

## General Information

### Team Name

The name of the team, visible to those booking team member tickets.

### Team Description

A description of the team, its function, how it operates and the expectations of those who request to join it.

### Team Image

An optional image to give a visual cue to what the team is.

Team images can be up to 8MB in size and any of the following file types: `PNG`, `JPEG` or `GIF`.

### Full-Time Members Required

The total number of full-time team members required for a team. Once this many people have applied to join the team, this option will be removed from the front-end team selection fields.

::: tip
The language of Full-Time and Part-Time can mean whatever you'd like it to mean for your event.
:::

### Part-Time Members Required

The total number of part-time team members required for a team. Once this many people have applied to join the team, this option will be removed from the front-end team selection fields.

### Team Code

You can distribute a team code for people to enter instead of them selecting from a dropdown list.

In some cases you may want to hide certain teams from the public as they book in as team members but still need to provide a mechanism for _some_ to choose the team.

::: warning
If this team is set to **unlisted** then using the code is the only way they'll be able to apply to join this team from the event frontend.
:::

::: tip
You may set a code of your own choosing, otherwise Solidrock will automatically generate one.
:::

### When is this team for?

Which of the created serving times a team is available for? More than 1 can be selected.

### Full-Time Discount

If applicable, select a pre-created discount that should be automatically applied to a team member ticket if 'full-time' is chosen.

::: tip
You may for example give 100% off the team member ticket price if a person chooses to be Full-time and 50% off for those working Part-Time.
:::

### Part-Time Discount

If applicable, select a pre-created discount that should be automatically applied to a team member ticket if 'part-time' is chosen.

### Access Levels

Which [access levels](/guide/teams/access) are applicable to this team.

::: tip
Solidrock can generate printed team passes/lanyards. Selected access levels are printed onto these passes.
:::

### Can be used on bookings site?

Enable this option to show the team (subject to there being places still available) on the frontend team dropdown fields within a team member ticket. If left off, the team will be 'unlisted'.
