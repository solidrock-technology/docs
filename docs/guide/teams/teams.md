### Team Code

You can distribute a team code for people to enter instead of them selecting from a dropdown list.

In some cases you may want to hide certain teams from the general public as they book in as team members but still need to provide a mechanism for _some_ to choose the team.

::: warning
If this team is set to **unlisted** then using the code is the only way they'll be able to apply to join this team from the event frontend.

::: tip
You may set a code of your own choosing, otherwise Solidrock will automatically generate one.
