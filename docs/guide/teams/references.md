# Team Member References

References are a way to capture either character references or references tailored around a specific team or role for a team member. They can be used to provide a level of assurance that a person is suitable for a team or role.

::: info Quick Tip
References must be enabled first with the 'Event Settings' for your event.
:::

When references are enabled for an event, all team member ticket types will have a 'References' section as part of the ticket details form. This will be required to be filled out before a person can complete their booking. The references section will request the full name and email address of the person or persons providing the reference(s).

Event organisers can see at a glance how many references are 'Pending' awaiting review from the counter badge on the 'References' navigation menu item in the event management area.

## Reference Types

References can be of two types:

1. **Character Reference** - A general reference that can be used for any team or role. Character references are requested where an event doesn't allow a team member to select a specific serving time or team to apply for.
2. **Team Reference** - A reference tailored to a specific team or role, a referee must be provided for every serving time and team application. The Referee will be informed of the team name and team description so that they can provide a reference that is relevant to the team or role.

## Reference Progress Status

Once a reference has been requested, the status of the reference will be displayed in the 'References' section of the teams area. The status can be one of the following:

1. **Not Started** - The referee has been informed they need to leave a reference, but they have not yet started it yet.
2. **In Progress** - The referee has started the reference, but not yet completed it.
3. **Completed** - The reference has been completed by the referee.
4. **Rejected** - The referee has rejected the reference. This could be because they don't know the person well enough, or they don't feel they can provide a reference for another reason.

## Reference Review Status

Once a reference has been completed, the event organiser can review the reference. The review status can be one of the following:

1. **Pending** - The reference has been completed but not yet reviewed by the event organiser.
2. **Reviewed** - The reference has been reviewed by the event organiser but has yet to be finalised as Accepted or Rejected.
3. **Accepted** - The reference has been reviewed and approved by the event organiser.
4. **Rejected** - The reference has been reviewed and rejected by the event organiser.

## Reference Notifications

When a reference is requested, the referee will receive an email with a link to complete the reference. The event organiser will also receive an email when a reference has been completed.

:::info Quick tip
The event organiser can manually resend the reference notification email to the referee from the 3-dot actions menu in the 'References' section of the event management area.
:::

A referee can quickly see and access the references they need to complete from their profile navigation dropdown menu.

## Reference Forms

A default reference form is provided for every event. This form can be customised by the event organiser to include additional questions or to remove questions that are not relevant to the event.

In addition, more reference forms can be created in Form Builder that are entirely bespoke to the event or specific teams. These forms can be assigned to specific teams from the team edit form and will be used in place of the default reference form.

## Altering the referee

If a referee is unable to complete a reference, has rejected it or a more suitable referee is found, the event organiser can change the referee for a team member by editing the team member's ticket. The new referee will be informed by email that they need to complete a reference.
