# Team Member Approvals Criteria

When someone books a team member ticket through Solidrock, in most cases, they are applying to join one or more selected teams. At this point they are in a 'Pending' state. Organisations are then required to review the team member application and make a decision about whether the applicant seems a good fit for the role or team they are applying to and then to approve or decline the application, or to move the applicant to a more appropriate team.

In order to make the best decision and in some cases for legal reasons there are often multiple steps an application must go through before it can reach an 'accepted' state. This is where Team Member Approval Criteria comes into play. Here you can set any number of steps or criteria that must be completed for an application to be completed. 

Some common examples of steps include:

- DBS
  - DBS Number Received
  - DBS Checked
  - DBS Approved
- Reference
  - Requested
  - Received
  - Reference Approved
- Parental Content
  - Consent Form Sent
  - Consent Received

With these set, when viewing a team member ticket in the backend you will be shown this list as a set of checkboxes ready to be ticked off as and when the criteria are met. Once all are complete, you may then approve an applicant onto a team.

::: tip
Approval criteria are completely optional. If your event team members don't need to go through any approval steps this can be left completely empty allowing you to approve a team member immediately.
