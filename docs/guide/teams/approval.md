# Team Member Approval Criteria

When someone books a team member ticket through Solidrock, in most cases, they are applying to join one or more selected teams. At this point they are in a 'Pending' state. Organisations are then required to review the team member application and make a decision about whether the applicant seems a good fit for the role or team they are applying to and then to approve or decline the application, or to move the applicant to a more appropriate team.

In order to make the best decision, and in some cases for legal reasons, there are often multiple steps an application must go through before it can reach an 'accepted' state. This is where Team Member Approval Criteria comes into play. Here you can set any number of steps or criteria that must be completed for an application to be completed.

Some common examples of steps include:

-   DBS
    -   DBS Number Received
    -   DBS Checked
    -   DBS Approved
-   Reference
    -   Requested
    -   Received
    -   Reference Approved
-   Parental Content
    -   Consent Form Sent
    -   Consent Received

With these set, when viewing a team member ticket in the backend you will be shown this list as a set of checkboxes ready to be ticked off as and when the criteria are met. Once all are complete, you may then approve an applicant onto a team.

## Adding Approval Criteria

Approval Criteria are managed within templates, allowing you to share the same criteria across multiple teams, or to have different criteria for different teams.

To add a new approval criteria, navigate to the 'Teams' section of the Solidrock backend and click on 'Approval Criteria' in the sidebar. Here you will see a list of all existing criteria templates. To add a new one, click the 'Create New Template' button at the top of the page.

You can name the template for easier reference elsewhere in the system, and then add as many criteria as you need. Each criterion is simply a name or title. Any criteria you've created previously and used in other templates will be available to re-sue in this template. Click on the criteria in the sidebar to add it to the template.

Criteria can be nested, allowing you to group related criteria together. This can be useful for grouping criteria by type, or by the stage in the process they are relevant to. To nest a criteria, simply click the cog icon and select the parent criteria from the dropdown. You can also re-order criteria within the template by dragging and dropping them into the desired order. Removing a criteria from the template is as simple as clicking the 'x' icon next to the criteria name.

## Applying a criteria template to a team

You can apply a criteria template to a team by editing the team in the backend and selecting the template from the 'Approval Criteria Template' dropdown. Once saved, any new team member tickets created for this team will use this template. If a team doesn't require any approval criteria you can select the 'No approval criteria' option.

::: tip
Approval criteria are completely optional. If your event team members don't need to go through any approval steps this can be left completely empty allowing you to approve a team member immediately.
