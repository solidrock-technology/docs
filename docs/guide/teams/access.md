# Team Access Levels

You may create any number of access levels that can be assigned to different teams needed for your event. Access levels with Solidrock serve no purpose beyond being a label that can be viewed in the backend by administrators and when printing Team Passes (Badges/Lanyards) from the system. On the printed pass, the access levels that each team and therefore each team member have for the team are written which can therefore be used as a visual security measure for those working at the event.

Access Levels can be anything you like, but some common examples are:

- Access All Areas (AAA)
- Backstage
- Green Room
- Operations
- Kids Venues
- Catering
