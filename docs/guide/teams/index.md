# Teams

Teams are an incredibly powerful part of Solidrock that enable event organisers to book in and manage teams at their events.

Within the teams management area event organisers can:

1. [Create and manage the individual teams](/guide/teams/teams.md)
2. [Set and manage team leaders](/guide/teams/leaders.md)
3. [Create and manage team member access levels](/guide/teams/access.md)
4. [Set approval critera](/guide/teams/approval.md) to determine the steps required for a person to be approved as a team member.
5. [Manage team member references](/guide/teams/references.md)
