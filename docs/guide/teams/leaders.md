# Team Leaders

Team Leaders in Solidrock enable a greater level of management control for your teams. At it's core a Team Leader is Solidrock account with the 'Team Leader' [account type](/guide/accounts.md#team-leaders). When an account has the Team Leader role they can access their profile to see all the team members that have been accepted to their team(s).

For convenience Organisation Administrators can see a list of all team leaders that have been setup within each of their events from the 'Team Leaders' link in the event sidebar.

Team Leaders are entirely optional in Solidrock
