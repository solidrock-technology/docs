# Form Builder

At Solidrock we know how important it is that events have the ability to capture the data from their delegates to be able to run a successful and safe event. With that in mind our custom [Form Builder](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/form-builder/forms) functionality puts the power into the event organisers hands to determine exactly what, how and about who that information should be requested.

The Form Builder is split into 2 distinct areas, first the forms themselves and 2nd the custom fields that can be shared across multiple forms and events.
