# Extras

Within any event you can create as many extras as you need to sell additional items outside of tickets, for example merchandise, accommodation and other services or utilities. Outlined below are all the available options and settings for event extras.

Like tickets, you can duplicate extras using the **&vellip;** icon and choosing the **Duplicate** option where needed.

## General Information

### Extra Name

The name of the extra that will be displayed throughout the front and backend of this event.

### Extra Description

Visible alongside the extra name on the frontend booking pages, and should be used to aid those booking in to know which extra(s) are right for them.

### Price

The fixed price of the extra.

### Total Available

The total number of this extra available. Once the number available have been added to bookings, the option to purchase this extra will be removed for lead bookers thereafter.

### Max per Lead Booker

The maximum number of an extra that can be purchased per lead booker across all of their bookings

### Max per Lead Booker _(Group Coordinators)_

For those logged in as Group Coordinators you can provide a different maximum purchase limit of an extra per booking.

### Max per Group

If you want to restrict the number of an extra that can be purchased within an entire group across multiple bookings you can set that value here.

### Available From Date/Time

The date and time that an extra should become available for purchase.

### Available To Date/Time

The date and time from which an extra should no longer be available for purchase.

### Status

Whether to make the extra available to bookers on the frontend or not.

::: tip
You can set an extra to **Disabled** and still provide a link directly to it on the frontend for specific people.

### Form Selection

Here you can choose a custom form you've already created to associate with an extra. Custom forms can contain any number of custom fields that you've created to capture delegate information or preferences necessary for the running of your event.

::: tip
You're often best to create your custom fields and forms ahead of then making your extras.

### Restriction by Ticket Type

If you want to restrict an extra to only show once a booking already has a particular type of ticket in it, you can turn this option on and then select which ticket types to apply.

::: tip
For example you may have extras that are relevant only to Team Members. To show an extra only for bookings in which there is at least 1 Team Member ticket added you would toggle this field on and then select 'Team Member' from the list.

### Restriction by Account Type

If you want to restrict an extra to only show for people logged in with a certain account type/role you can turn this option on and then choose the relevant account types.
