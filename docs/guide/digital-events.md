# Digital Events

## General Information

If your event is an online or digital event, or has a digital component, you can turn this module on by first of all setting the [Digital Event Streaming](/guide/events.md#digital-event-streaming) toggle on within the Event Info page.

### Digital Event Start Date

This is the date and time that you expect to start the online event.

### Timezone

Set the timezone for your digital event start date.

### Access Date

This is the date and time that you want to allow people to access the event page. You may for example set this to 30 minutes before the start date and time so that people can be logged in and ready ahead of the event beginning.

### Maximum Logins Per Ticket

In most cases the digital event page will be secured behind a simpe login. The login requires a valid ticket ID from Solidrock (each purchased ticket is assigned a unique ID that is sent to the lead booker). 

Here you can set how many times a single Ticket ID can be used to login to the event. For example you may set this to a low number so that a single ticket ID can't be distrubitued to a group of people to gain access. Alternatively you may set this number in the thousands and distribute a single ID yourselves to many people so that they'd all login under the same ID.

::: tip
If you've set this number low and a ticket holder ends up locking themselves out of the event by accident (perhaps they tried to login across multiple different devices during the course of the event), you can reset the number of uses back to '0' from the event tickets page.

### Guest Access Allowed?

If enabled the digital event pages will be accessible to anyone without needing to login using a ticket ID.

## Video Details

### Video ID

Solidrock currently integrates with Vimeo and YouTube platforms. Enter your video's unique ID from either of those platforms.

### Does the video play inline?

Whether or not on mobile and some tablet devices the video should play inline within the page or open fullscreen. The default behaviour for many mobile devices is for videos to play fullscreen.

### Does the video autoplay?

Whether or not the video will attempt to autoplay when the page is loaded and the event is live, or whether all delegates would be required to press a play icon/button to start the video.

::: tip
To provide the best browser compatability, autoplaying videos will be muted. The delegate will have controls to unmute the video.

### Does the video loop?

Whether or not the video will loop back to the start when it ends and continue playing.

### Hide video stream until the event start time is reached

If turned on we'll show the event image until the event start date is reached, at which point we'll replace the image with the video.

### Display countdown timer before event starts

If turned on we'll show a timer that counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until the digital event start date.

## Content

### Stream Page Title

This large title text shows at the top of the stream page.

### Announcement

The annoucement is overlaid at the bottom of the video and can be updated whilst the digital event runs to send messages to delegates.

### Summary

This text shows directly underneath the live stream video as an introduction to the digital event. It is larger and more prominent that the main content area.

### Main Page Content Area

Use this area to enrich your livestream page. You can use rich text formatting, add images and embed additional content such as videos, audio clips or engagement tools from sites such as Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud or Videoask. You can update this content while the digital event is live and it will be pushed to all those people viewing the event with a need for them to refresh their webpage.
