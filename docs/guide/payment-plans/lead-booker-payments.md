# Payment Plans - Lead Booker Payments

## Auto-collected Payments
If your payment plan was set up with the 'Automatically Collect Payment' field enabled, we will automatically try and collect the payment from the card used for the initial purchase. This functionality is only available for Stripe orders.<br>
If the payment was successful, the instalment will automatically be marked as Paid and the order's amount paid will increase by the instalment amount.<br>
If the payment failed, an email will be sent to the Lead Booker asking them to manually pay for their instalment (see [Manual Payments](#manual-payments)).

## Instalment Reminders
Instalment reminders will be sent out when an instalment is due within 2 days. If the payment plan is set to auto-collect the payment, this will be mentioned in the email and Lead Bookers will not at that point need to take any action.<br>
If the payment plan is not set to auto-collect the payment, the email will either contain a link to pay the invoice through the payment portal, or for BACs orders, will contain the details necessary for the Lead Bookers to pay the invoice.

## Manual Payments
A Lead Booker can manually pay for instalments through the payment portal within their profile area.
This can be used for Lead Bookers who want to pay for an instalment early, for instalments that have failed when being automatically collected, or for payment instalments that are not automatically collected.
