# Payment Plans

Payment Plans within Solidrock allow lead bookers a method to pay for their orders over multiple instalments, rather than as one full payment.
As an Organisation Admin, you can set up plans to take payments weekly or monthly in the lead up to your events, even having the instalments attempt to collect the payment automatically.
All the instalments are automatically created when a Lead Booker pays their deposit amount, which is also customisable on a per-plan basis.
