# Organisations

## Organisation Name

The event name is shown in multiple places across the Solidrock Booking System but primarily within the frontend booking experience for delegeates. They will see this within the event summary cards if your event is set to `public`, on the event landing page and within email communications (such as invoices and receipts) regarding your event.

## Slug

The organisation slug is what appears in the unique Solidrock URL for your organisation and events. Typically the organisation slug would be similar to the name, such that it would predomintantely contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens. By way of example if the organisation slug was set to `mega-events`, the frontend landing page for the organisation would be reachable at `https://events.solidrock.io/mega-event` which would list out all future, public events.

::: warning
Once a slug has been set for an organisation it cannot be changed in the future.
