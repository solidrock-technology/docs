# Roadmap

Upcoming planned and in-progress features for Solidrock!

-   Ability for event admins to alter a ticket option for a purchased ticket. For example, changing and ticket within an order from a 5-10s ticket to an 11-18s ticket.
-   Updating an Order's activity log to include when an order invoice has been issued for those orders paying by BACs
-   Email notification for event admins when a new grup has been registered publicly.
-   Email notification for group coordinators when a new ticket has been added to their group.
-   Adding Apple Pay and Google Pay optoins to checkout
-   Adding field setting option to customise a fields label within a specific form if wanting to re-use the same field across multiple forms. For example renaming the 'First Name' field to 'Delegate First Name'.
-   Email notification for Leab Bookers if they have an unpaid order with tickets or extras due to expire as a price break approaches.
-   Updates to event dashboard to provide more at-a-glance details.
-   Allow events to delete unpaid, inactive orders after a specified timeframe (e.g. after 8 hours of inactivity) to prevent scarce tickets and extras being held within unpaid orders indefinitely.
