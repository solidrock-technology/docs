# Updates

## 26th July 2022

With in-person events now a real thing again (🙏🏻 *Hopefully we've said goodbye to COVID restrictions for good* 🙏🏻) we've spent some time refining and updating the delegate arrivals and check-in experience as well as bring the [Box Office](/guide/front-of-house/box-office) out of beta! We've brought all these features under one roof we're calling ['Front of House'](/guide/front-of-house).

With these updates we now also offer support for USB and Bluetooth HID barcode scanners and, now that we've revamped the check in and out process allowing multiple records per ticket, we've setup a new 'Check In' report so you can pull out this detail.

As always with our releases we bring further tuning to the performance of the platform and a healthy dose of bug fixes.

## 1st July 2022

In this update we've only gone and ticked off one of the most requested features - Payment Plans! Not to mention a plethora of bug fixes, updates to whole backend look and feel as well as wristband assingment and scanning. If it's been a bit quiet around here lately, now you know why!

### Payment Plans

Want to offer the option to your customers to pay a deposit and subsequent weekly or monthly instalments for their order? Now you can! Deposit amount and number of instalments are completely customisable. You can even offer multiple payment plans to the customer for them to choose the most appropriate option for them.

Orders can of course always be paid in full at checkout by card or, in certain circumstances, by BACs (Bank Transfer) too. Payment plans build on these payment methods allowing you the option to attempt automatic collection of an instalment where a customer is paying by card. Where this isn't possible (if the customer is paying instalments by BACs) or fails (e.g. the saved card on record has since expired) then an instalment payment instruction is sent directing the customer on how to pay the scheduled instalment either by making another bank transfer, or by logging into their Solidrock profile and paying by card.

### Wristband Assignment

If your event uses wristbands, or any other uniquely identifiable ID pass on-site you can now assign these to tickets within Solidrock either by entering the unique ID of the band or pass, or by scanning a QR Code or Barcode. Wristbands can be assigned ahead of the event, during check-in or through the box-office.

Once assigned a search can be performed on a wristband ID or a QR/Barcode scanned to pull up the associated ticket details. 

### Design updates for the backend

We've been busy bringing some visual updates to the backend, unifying the design and pages throughout. But it doesn't stop there, we've also refined search and filtering across the board and brought in tons of enhancements here and there. We can't wait for you to see them.


## 7th February 2022

This updated primarily focussed on improvements to the underlying hosting infrastructure to increase performance of the system under heavier loads. There was also a healthy amount of 🐛  squashing **and** some quality of life improvements tucked away for event organisers.

### Archiving old events

Tidy up your event lists by archiving old, past events!

::: tip
From the event list page in the backend open up the event options menu (by clicking on the cog) and selecting 'Archive' from the list of options.
:::

Archived event data is still fully accessible and is now accessed from a more desicrete list on the same event list page. Archivfed events do not show in the 'My Events' navigation.

### Extras Chart

For events that sell extras, we've added a new chart to event dashboards to provide at a glance statistics on the number of extras sold, indiciating the number that are full paid, and those in Pending (BACs) orders.

### Quick link to documentation & guide

In the event sidebar navigation you'll now find a new link to this documentation site where we'll host guides, tutorials, FAQs and release notes!

## Previous Releases

Solidrock Booking System is under constant development. Some worthy mentions for recent improvements include:

### Event Check-in

From the event sidebar navigation you can access the check-in link that will load up the event arrivals and check-in pages. From here you can either scan a ticket's QR code to check-in an individual ticket or search for and entire order by entering the unique order reference to then check-in one or more tickets.

::: tip
Checked-in tickets will be indicated as such within the backend event ticket list by a visual &check; symbol.

The Ticket List report also provides a new 'Checked in Date' column showing the date and time a ticket was checked in to the event.
