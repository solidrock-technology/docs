## 7th February 2022

This updated primarily focussed on improvements to the underlying hosting infrastructure to increase performance of the system under heavier loads. There was also a healthy amount of üêõ  squashing **and** some quality of life improvements tucked away for event organisers.

### Archiving old events

Tidy up your event lists by archiving old, past events!

::: tip
From the event list page in the backend open up the event options menu (by clikcing on the cog) and selecting 'Archive' from the list of options.
:::

Archived event data is still fully accessible and is now accessed from a more desicrete list on the same event list page. Archivfed events do not show in the 'My Events' navigation.

### Extras Chart

For events that sell extras, we've added a new chart to event dashboards to provide at a glance statistics on the number of extras sold, indiciating the number that are full paid, and those in Pending (BACs) orders.

### Quick link to documentation & guide

In the event sidebar navigation you'll now find a new link this documentation site where we'll host guides, tutorials, FAQs and release notes!

### Event Check-in

From the event sidebar navigation you can access the check-in link that will load up the event arrivals and check-in pages. From here you can either scan a ticket's QR code to check-in an individual ticket or search for and entire order by entering the unique order reference to then check-in one or more tickets.

::: tip
Checked-in tickets will be indicated as such within the backend event ticket list by a visual &check; symbol.

The Ticket List report also provides a new 'Checked in Date' column showing the date and time a ticket was checked in to the event.
