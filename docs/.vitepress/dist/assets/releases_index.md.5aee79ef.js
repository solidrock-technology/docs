Event Admins now have the ability to chage this code to be something a little less random and a little more memorable!</p><h3 id="event-emails" tabindex="-1">Event Emails <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-emails" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Emails&quot;">​</a></h3><p>They been a little while coming but we are finally ready to release two new automated emails that can be enabled per event.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Unassigned Tickets Reminder:</strong> This email is sent to all Lead Bookers who have a booking with tickets that are still missing required form information (e.g. DOB, Dietary Requirements, etc) 1 week before the order editing cut-off date. This is especially useful if the event is setup to allow Group Coordinators or anybody to complete a booking without first providing this information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Tickets:</strong> Until now a Lead Booker needed to login to their Solidrock profile to download their tickets. This email simplifies the process significantly by emailing the tickets to them at an appropriate date specified by the event admins using the <code>Digital Ticket Delivery Date</code> field.</p></li></ol><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>Any booking that is completed and paid for after the Digital Ticket Delivery Date will have their tickets emailed immediately.</p></div><h2 id="october-2022" tabindex="-1">October 2022 <a class="header-anchor" href="#october-2022" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;October 2022&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="group-management" tabindex="-1">Group Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#group-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Group Management&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Alongside all the usual bug fixing and performance tuning we made managing groups simpler at the event level in this update. By creating two new areas in the main event navigation for viewing the &#39;Group List&#39; and &#39;Group Coordinators&#39; it is easier than ever to see which groups are attending an event and to access to key contact details for the group coordinators.</p><h3 id="faqs" tabindex="-1">FAQs <a class="header-anchor" href="#faqs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;FAQs&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Based on conversations we have with our incredible event administrators we compiled an initial set of <a href="/faqs/">FAQs</a> which we&#39;ll be adding to over time.</p><h3 id="event-ticket-limit" tabindex="-1">Event Ticket Limit <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-ticket-limit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Ticket Limit&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is now a new <code>Ticket Limit</code> option within an event&#39;s settings which acts as a hard limit across all ticket options. When that limit is reached no further tickets can be booked.</p><h2 id="july-2022" tabindex="-1">July 2022 <a class="header-anchor" href="#july-2022" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;July 2022&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In this update we&#39;ve only gone and ticked off one of the most requested features - Payment Plans! Not to mention a plethora of bug fixes, updates to the whole backend look and feel as well as wristband assignment and scanning. If it&#39;s been a bit quiet around here lately, now you know why!</p><h3 id="payment-plans" tabindex="-1">Payment Plans <a class="header-anchor" href="#payment-plans" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Payment Plans&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Want to offer the option to your customers to pay a deposit and subsequent weekly or monthly instalments for their order? Now you can! Deposit amount and number of instalments are completely customisable. You can even offer multiple payment plans to the customer for them to choose the most appropriate option for them.</p><p>Orders can of course always be paid in full at checkout by card or, in certain circumstances, by BACs (Bank Transfer) too. Payment plans build on these payment methods allowing you the option to attempt automatic collection of an instalment where a customer is paying by card. Where this isn&#39;t possible (if the customer is paying instalments by BACs) or fails (e.g. the saved card on record has since expired) then an instalment payment instruction is sent directing the customer on how to pay the scheduled instalment either by making another bank transfer, or by logging into their Solidrock profile and paying by card.</p><h3 id="wristband-assignment" tabindex="-1">Wristband Assignment <a class="header-anchor" href="#wristband-assignment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wristband Assignment&quot;">​</a></h3><p>With in-person events now a real thing again (🙏🏻 <em>Hopefully we&#39;ve said goodbye to COVID restrictions for good</em> 🙏🏻) we&#39;ve spent some time refining and updating the delegate arrivals and check-in experience as well as bring the <a href="/guide/front-of-house/box-office.html">Box Office</a> out of beta! We&#39;ve brought all these features under one roof we&#39;re calling <a href="/guide/front-of-house/">&#39;Front of House&#39;</a>.</p><p>With these updates we now also offer support for USB and Bluetooth HID barcode scanners and, now that we&#39;ve revamped the check in and out process allowing multiple records per ticket, we&#39;ve setup a new &#39;Check In&#39; report so you can pull out this detail.</p><p>If your event uses wristbands, or any other uniquely identifiable ID pass on-site you can now assign these to tickets within Solidrock either by entering the unique ID of the band or pass, or by scanning a QR Code or Barcode. Wristbands can be assigned ahead of the event, during check-in or through the box-office.</p><p>Once assigned, a search can be performed on a wristband ID or a QR/Barcode scanned to pull up the associated ticket details.</p><h3 id="design-updates-for-the-backend" tabindex="-1">Design updates for the backend <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-updates-for-the-backend" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design updates for the backend&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We&#39;ve been busy bringing some visual updates to the backend, unifying the design and pages throughout. But it doesn&#39;t stop there, we&#39;ve also refined search and filtering across the board and brought in tons of enhancements here and there. We can&#39;t wait for you to see them.</p><h2 id="february-2022" tabindex="-1">February 2022 <a class="header-anchor" href="#february-2022" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;February 2022&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This update primarily focussed on improvements to the underlying hosting infrastructure to increase performance of the system under heavier loads.
