# Team Members & References

## Why does a referee see a message saying there are no references to complete?

If a team member application requires a reference, the team member will be required to provide the name and email address of a suitable referee. When the application is submitted, the referee will receive an email with a link to login to complete the reference.

Once logged in, if the referee sees a message saying there are no references to complete, it is likely that they have logged in to a Solidrock account that uses a different email address to the referee email address provided by the team member in their application.

To confirm this, the referee can check the email address they received the reference request email to. If it is different to the email address they are logged in with, they will need to log out and log back in using the email address provided by the team member.

In some cases it may be appropriate for an event organiser to update the referee email address associated with the team member application to one associated with an existing Solidrock account to save a person needing to create a new account. This can be done by the event organiser in the team member application details page.
