# Tickets, Extras & Bundles

## How do I set up time restricted items?

When creating or editing a ticket, extra or bundle, you have the option to mark that item as 'Time Restricted'. This option enables a 30-minute inactivity timer while that item is in an unpaid order. If the Lead Booker does not extend their session by remaining active within their order such as continuting through the booking process, then the time-restricted items will be deleted from their order.

Good candidates for time restricted items are those where there is a very limited supply and you want to ensure that they are not held in unpaid orders for long periods of time such as a limited number of hotel rooms or a limited number of pre-sale tickets at a much lower cost.

:::info Bundles
A Bundle will automatically become time-restricted if any of the items within the bundle are marked as time-restricted.
