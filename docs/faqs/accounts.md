## How do I register Group Coordinators?

There are 2 primary ways Group Coordinators can be registered within Solidrock. The first, by having an event organiser register the account or add the account category to an existing account. And the 2nd to have a person self-register as a Group Coordinator.

### 1. Registered by Organisation Admin

Before creating a Group Coordinator in this way you will need to have first set up the group they will be assigned to from the 'Admin Console' > ['Groups'](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/groups) area.

Having done that organisation admins can then register group coordinators from the 'Admin Console' > ['Accounts'](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/accounts) area. If you know the person you're setting up as a Group Coordinator already has a Solidrock account you can first search for them in the account list then using the actions menu choose to 'Edit' the account. At the bottom of the edit page you have the option to 'Add new account type' which when clicked will display a pop-up window. From here set:

-   'Select a category' to 'Group Coordinator'
-   'Select an organisation' to your organisation (if you manage multiple organisations in Solidrock more than one may be listed)
-   'Select and event' to the event that you want them to be a group coordinator for
-   'Select a group set' to the set that their group belongs to.
-   'Select a group item' to the group that they will coordinate.

You can optionally choose to notify the person by email and click 'Save changes' to apply this account type.

If the person **does not** already have a Solidrock account you will need to register them an account by clicking the green 'Create account' button from the main accounts page and fill in their first name, last name and email address as a bare minimum and set up the account type following the same instructions as above to specify the type, event, group set and group item. Click the green 'Create account' button to complete the registration.

### 2. Self-registered Group Coordinators

If an event is set up to allow 'Public Group Registrations' any member of the public who has created a Solidrock account will be able to register their group for that given event by specifying the group's name and location. The person registering the group will automatically become the Group Coordinator.
