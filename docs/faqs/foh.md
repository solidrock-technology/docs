# Front of House

## Arrivals & Check-in

### How do I arrive people at my event?

Using Solidrock's Front of House suite of functions you can manage checking people in as they arrive at your event, as well as being able to manage the check-in and out on a per-venue basis throughout the course of your event.

For arrivals at the event, you can use the ['Arrivals'](/guide/front-of-house/arrivals) feature to search by:

-   Delegate name
-   Order Reference
-   Unique Ticket ID
-   Event Pass/Wristband ID
-   Group Name or Code

You also have the option to scan-to-search which works either by using a device's camera or a barcode reader to read the QR code from Solidrock's digital tickets or a barcode/QR code on an event pass or wristband you have issued that has been allocated to a ticket within Solidrock.

### Can I check people in and out of venues at my event?

Yes, you can! Using the ['Check in & out'](/guide/front-of-house/check-in-out) feature you can manage the check-in and out of delegates on a per-venue basis throughout the course of your event. This feature is particularly useful for events that have multiple venues or areas that require different levels of access control.

You can search for delegates to check-in or out by:

-   Delegate name
-   Unique Ticket ID
-   Event Pass/Wristband ID

:::info Hint
You can easily reset the number of checked-in people at a venue by clicking the 'Reset' button on the venue's check-in settings page.
