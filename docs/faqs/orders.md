# Orders

## Where can a lead booker find their tickets?

Lead bookers can first find their orders (incomplete, pending and paid) from their ['My Bookings'](https://events.solidrock.io/admin/profile/my-bookings) page within their Solidrock profile.

From here they can continue where they left off with any incomplete order and (subject to the event settings) update the details of paid for tickets and extras in pending and paid orders.

Digital tickets are available for **Paid orders only**

## How do I reconcile a Pending BACs order?

Once you have confirmed you've received the bank transfer into your bank account you can update the related order within Solidrock to mark it as paid. To do so, first find the order from your event's 'Order List' page (searching by order reference or lead booker name should bring back the order).

:::info Hint
Solidrock instructs the Lead Booker paying by BACs to use the order reference as the payment reference for the bank transfer.

Using the 3 dots action menu choose to 'Edit' the order. You can also access the edit page from the order 'Show' page by clicking on the 'Order Options' button and choosing 'Edit Order' from the menu.

On the order edit page update the 'Amount Paid' field to match the amount you received by bank transfer (we'll show you the total value of the order, so you can easily see if the transferred amount is equal to the full value of the order). If the order has been fully paid set the 'Payment Status' dropdown to 'Paid' (if not you may want to leave the status as pending). Click the 'Update Order' to save the changes.

## How do I refund an order on a payment plan?

Refunding an order that has been paid for in full is a simple process, but when the order is still in the process of being paid for through a payment plan it can be a little more complex. To refund an order that is still in the process of being paid for you will need to first cancel the payment plan and then refund the amount that has been paid so far.

**To do this:**

1. Find the order from your event's 'Order List' page (searching by order reference or lead booker name should bring back the order).
2. Using the 3 dots action menu choose to 'Show' the order.
3. From the order 'Show' page click on the 'Order Options' button and choose 'Cancel Payment Plan' from the menu. This action will cancel and remove all overdue and scheduled payment plan instalments and update the order payment status to 'Pending'.
4. Refunds can only be made to 'Paid' orders so you will need to update the order to 'Paid' before you can refund the amount that has been paid so far. To do this click on the 'Edit Order' button from the order 'Show' page and update the 'Payment Status' dropdown to 'Paid'. Click the 'Update Order' button to save the changes.
5. Now you can refund the amount that has been paid so far by clicking on the 'Refund' button from the order 'Show' page. You will be asked to confirm the amount to refund and the reason for the refund before the refund is processed.
